Node version: 18.13.0 (lts)

Weird things
    -   @latest when bringing in next.js will give you some additional folders
        that make it confusing. And the one line install for next tailwind only 
        loads up typescript extensions
            -     install these dependencies seperately, and don't use the @latest next
            -     set up your files.associations in your 'settings JSON user preferences'

    -   on deploy to netlify i had to :
        -   go into my next.config.js file and include: target: 'serverless'
        -   got to the netlify UI and install Next.js Runtime
